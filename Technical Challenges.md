# Technical Challenges 

This section is for documenting the errors I faced and the solutions to them. 

This course was a great learning experience, and through making mistakes, and debugging errors I was able to really get hands-on experience with the tools almost like an internship. 



WORK IN PROGRESS

## Week 3 


### Week 4
